# 🏙️ Urban Monitoring Center – Java Simulation Project

This repository contains the implementation of a **City Monitoring Center Simulator**, designed to oversee and coordinate networks of urban traffic and security devices. The project applies object-oriented programming principles using Java, and integrates key software engineering concepts such as visual interfaces, multithreading, event handling, persistence, and data processing.

## 🎯 Project Objective

The goal of this practical work is to develop a simulator that replicates the behavior of a city's centralized monitoring system. This system must be capable of:

- Controlling and visualizing the status of multiple device networks, including:
  - **Traffic lights**
  - **Security cameras**
  - **Automated enforcement cameras (photo-fine cameras)**

- Detecting and reporting device failures to the monitoring center.

- Processing traffic infractions through image recognition and vehicle identification, forwarding data to the **Transit Authority**, where fines are generated and linked to vehicle owners.

- Displaying simulated real-time footage from security cameras, enabling operators to notify the appropriate emergency services (ambulance, police, fire department, or transit office) in response to abnormal events.

- Generating reports and analytics based on the usage and data collected by the system.

## 🛠️ Technologies & Techniques

- **Language:** Java  
- **Core concepts applied:**
  - Object-oriented design
  - Visual programming
  - Exception handling

## 📦 Repository Contents

- `src/` – Source code organized by domain components
- `docs/` – Architecture documentation and UML diagrams
- `README.md` – Project overview and instructions

## 🚀 Getting Started

To run the simulator:
1. Clone this repository.
2. Ensure you have Java 17 or higher installed.
3. Build the project using Maven or your preferred Java IDE.
4. Launch the simulation via the main entry point in `UrbanMonitoringCenter`.

## 💡 Future Enhancements

This project is extensible and designed for integration with:
- Real-time data feeds
- Data persistence
- Multithreading
- Graphical user interface using GMapsFX for the live map view
- Expanded device types and violation categories
